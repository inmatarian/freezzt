1. INTRODUCTION

ZZT-OOP, or ZZT-Object Oriented Programming, is a very easy and concise 
language. It doesn't contain much, and is easy to learn. I have a file called 
"ZZT-OOP Programming Language Reference Manual." I have no idea how I got it, 
but would like to credit it as an outside source, for it is what taught me the 
language which I can assist everyone at GameFAQs in learning. ZZT came to me in 
two doses, and I don't know if this reference manual came with either, or if I 
or someone else in this household who used ZZT typed it up. However, I have it 
now and it is very useful.
ZZT-OOP is used in the text of objects and scrolls. However, objects and 
scrolls bear major differences that will be described in Chapter 8. I will 
hereafter speak only of "objects," but know that most of what I describe 
applies to both, except where there are differences, which will be listed. 
Anyway, read on and email me if there is a question.

2. FORMAT

(Symbols)

ZZT-OOP contains 8 symbols that tell ZZT what comes after is not to be treated 
as regular text. The symbols are: @ # : / ? ! $ '

@objectname
The "at" symbol denotes, in the first line of code, the title of the object. 
The title is shown to the user as its name and is used to receive messages from 
other objects. If the object has no title, or the title contains space bars, 
the object cannot receive messages from other objects.

#command
The pound sign denotes a command to the object. Commands will be listed in 
Chapter 6.

:label
The colon denotes a point in the code that can be accessed later using the SEND 
command. There are five specific labels that can also be accessed through other 
interaction; those will be described in Chapter 3.

/direction
The forward slash tells the object to move in the given direction. For more 
information, see the GO command.

?direction
The question mark tells the object to try movement in the given direction. For 
more information, see the TRY command.

!message;text
The exclamation point denotes a menu choice accessed by the user. These are 
choices that the user can highlight and press "Enter" to be sent to a label in 
the code.

$text
The dollar sign denotes a line of text that will be centered to the user and 
appear white. It does nothing special except make the text look better.

'comment
The apostrophe denotes a line of comment code. Comment code is for the 
programmer only, and is completely ignored by ZZT.

(Text)

Text is what the user reads while playing ZZT. This text is denoted by having 
none of the above symbols before the text. The only other types of code visible 
to the user are the buttons (!) and the centered text ($).

3. MESSAGES

There are five special messages that are accessed not only by using the SEND 
command. These five messages are:

:TOUCH, when the player touches the object.
:SHOT, when the object is hit with a bullet.
:BOMBED, when the object is in the blast radius of a bomb.
:THUD, when the object hits a wall during the WALK command.
:ENERGIZED, when the player touches an energizer.

4. DIRECTIONS

Movement in ZZT is initiated with the valid directions, which range from the 
basic compass directions to random directions. The directions are:

N (NORTH), S (SOUTH), E (EAST), and W (WEST), the compass directions.
I (IDLE), the stationary direction.
SEEK, toward the player.
FLOW, the current direction.
OPP <direction>, opposite to the given direction.
CW <direction>, clockwise from the given direction.
CCW <direction>, counter-clockwise from the given direction.
RNDNS, random, north or south.
RNDNE, random, north or east.
RNDP <direction>, a random direction perpendicular to the given direction.

5. FLAGS

(Flag variables)

Flag variables are true/false variables. They are either SET or CLEAR/ Their 
status is changed with the SET and CLEAR commands.

(Internal flags)

Internal flags have to do with an object's surroundings. They include:

ALLIGNED, whether the object is aligned horizontally or vertically with the 
player.
CONTACT, whether the object is touching the player.
BLOCKED <direction>, whether the object's path is obstructed in the given 
direction.
ENERGIZED, whether the player is currently under the effect of an energizer.

6. COMMANDS

Commands tell the object to perform a specific action. Commands include:

#BECOME <kind> tells the object to change into the specified type of item or 
terrain. If no color is specified, the object retains its original color.
#BIND <objectname> changes the object's code to that of the specified object.
#CHANGE <kind> <kind> changes all occurrences of a certain type of item or 
terrain into another. If no color is specified, it changes every color.
#CHAR <number> changes the object's character to that of the specified number.
#CLEAR <flag variable> changes the status of the specified flag variable to 
CLEAR.
#CYCLE <number> changes the cycle speed of the object to the specified number. 
Speed ranges from 1 (fastest) to 255 (slowest). The default is 3.
#DIE removes the object from the game.
#END ends interaction with the object until it is triggered again.
#ENDGAME removes all the player's health, ending the game.
#GIVE <item> <quantity> gives the specified amount of the specified item to the 
player. Items to give are AMMO, GEMS, TORCHES, HEALTH, and SCORE.
#GO <direction> moves the object in the specified direction. If movement is 
blocked, the object will stand until it can move or until another message is 
received. This is equivalent to /
#IDLE keeps the object stationary for a moment. This is equivalent to /I
#IF <flag> [THEN] <message> tests the value of the specified flag, and if it is 
SET, sends programming to the specified message. The THEN is not required.
#LOCK puts the object into "locked" mode, which means it cannot receive 
incoming messages.
#PLAY <sound> plays the specified music. Music information is listed in Chapter 
7.
#PUT <direction> <kind> puts the specified type of item or terrain in the 
specified direction.
#RESTART sends interaction to the first line of the object's code.
#RESTORE <message> restores the first instance of the specified label that was 
ZAPped.
#SEND <message> sends interaction to the specified label.
#SEND <objectname>:<message> sends interaction of the specified object to the 
specified label.
#SET <flag variable> changes the status of the specified flag variable to SET.
#SHOOT <direction> fires a bullet in the specified direction.
#TAKE <item> <number> [<message>] takes from the player the specified amount of 
the specified item. If the player does not have enough, none is taken and, if a 
message is specified, interaction is sent there.
#THROWSTAR <direction> sends a star, which tries to hit the player, in the 
given direction.
#TRY <direction> tries to move the object in the given direction. If movement 
is blocked, the command is ignored. This is equivalent to ?
#UNLOCK takes the object out of "locked" mode, which means it can receive 
incoming messages.
#WALK <direction> makes the object start to walk in the specified direction. 
The object will keep moving that way until it receives the WALK IDLE command or 
until it walks into a wall, in which case the THUD message will be sent.
#ZAP <message> changes the pound sign at the beginning of the first instance of 
the specified message to an apostrophe, making it comment code and rendering 
the message "zapped." The message can be restored with the RESTORE command.

7. MUSIC

Music is played with notes and rests preceded by parameters that describe the 
length of the note, among other things.

(Notes and Rests)

X is rest
A - G are basic piano notes sometimes followed by:
# is sharp
! is flat

(Parameters)

T denotes a 32nd note.
S denotes a sixteenth note.
I denotes an eighth note.
Q denotes a quarter note.
H denotes a half note.
W denotes a whole note.
3 denotes triplets, meaning the three notes that follow take up the time of the 
one length specified.
. denotes time-and-a-half, meaning the note that follows takes up one and a 
half times as long.
+ denotes going up one octave.
- denotes going down one octave.

(Sound effects)

0 tick
1 tweet
2 cowbell
4 high snare
5 high woodblock
6 low snare
7 low tom
8 low woodblock
9 bass drum

8. OBJECTS VS. SCROLLS

Objects and scrolls both contain ZZT-OOP language. However, they have many 
differences. The interaction differences are that objects begin with their 
first line of code upon entering the room, while scrolls do when touched, and 
that objects simply stand idle when interaction ends, while scrolls die. Other 
major differences are that scrolls cannot move or change character. Which also 
means that their beginning character is always the same, and that color is not 
specified.
Other than that, objects and scrolls are the same. Scrolls can shoot or change 
terrain types just like objects, etc.

9. CHAR LIST

This is a list of the characters for objects in ZZT so they can be changed 
using the CHAR command. I have also listed if any CHARs share their character 
with that of a set item or terrain.
