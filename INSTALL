Building From Source
====================

Dependencies
------------

1. Satisfy these dependencies first:
  - cmake
  - cmake-curses-gui
  - libsdl

  Under Debian and Ubuntu, you would do that like so:

  $ sudo aptitude install build-essential cmake \
  cmake-curses-gui libsdl-dev

2. Go to the build directory to do an out-of-source-build

  $ cd build

3. Use CMake to generate makefiles

  $ cmake ..

  Or alternatively use the cmake-curses-gui you installed.

  $ ccmake ..

  Remember to press C and G.

4. Run make

  make

5. And that's it for now. Installing is TODO.
